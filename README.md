# Stock-Prediction-AI-project
This was a project made for fun to look at the rmse from different machine learning models and pick the best model to predict a stocks price. 
This project is not completely finished but at the moment allows for the user to enter a stock ticker and plots are displayed to show how 
accurate the models predictions are.
